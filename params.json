With user prodided meta-data, Pymagor will automatically align multiple image files for each stimulus condition and field-of-view combinations. You can export a PDF summary report and a mat file (or npz) for later analysis.\r\n\r\nSupported platform(s)\r\n------\r\nPymagor is made with Python and cross-platform libraries. However, at moment, the primaly target platform is Windows XP/7, alghtough it will be relatively easy to support Linux and Mac.\r\n* MS-Windows 7, XP (win8 not tested)\r\n* (Ubuntu, may need a few adjustments)\r\n* (Mac? I do not have one)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------\r\n\r\n### Recommended way (no Python required!)\r\n\r\n* Get the binary installer and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. You **do not** need Python to run Pymagor.\r\n\r\n### Hard way (for dev)\r\n\r\n1. Install the latest Python 2.7 series. Python(x,y) recommended on Windows.\r\n2. Install all the Dependencies. Python(x,y) covers most of these.\r\n  * pillow\r\n  * numpy\r\n  * scipy\r\n  * matplotlib\r\n  * xlrd\r\n  * xlwt\r\n  * wx\r\n  * win32process (MS-Windows only)\r\n  * yapsy\r\n  * tifffile\r\n3. Clone the git repogitory (https://github.com/i-namekawa/Pymagor.git) and you are ready to go. \r\n\r\nNote: **Don't** attempt to `python setup.py install`. Pymagor is a stand-alone program not a module. Just run Pymagor2.py. `setup.py` is for py2exe packaging only. To build an executable using py2exe, you will need git.exe in the system path.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPymagor is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the LICENSE.txt file.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
